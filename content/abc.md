##EVER
```


Have you ever listen to birds chirping with their christ

Have you ever noticed the innocent smile of child

Have you ever felt relief by doing something for reconcile

Have you ever enjoy doing creepiest things in your life

Have you ever tried to see this beautiful galaxy with close eyes

Have you ever tried to learn anything beyond the limitations of sky

Have you ever enjoy making fun of your friend with little anger in disguise

Have you ever tried to find the boundaries of dreamful eyes

Try to cherish this natural music before the songs beeps

Because we have promises to keep and miles to go before sleep

Try to stay away from limelight it convey us from gleam

Don't stop iminish things because they are not what they seems
